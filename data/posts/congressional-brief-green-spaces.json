  "bodyMarkdown": "Hi, my name is Camila, and today I will talk to you about the importance of having access to green spaces, specifically the need for more green spaces in Little Havana. I grew up inLittle Havana, which is in Miami-Dade County, Florida. Nothing compares to growing up there, it is an immersion in different cultures. The neighborhood was established in the 1960s after an influx of Cuban immigrants arrived in Miami. It is a working-class neighborhood and people often do not have a lot of political involvement. The people of Little Havana are some of the most hard-working individuals I know, they all come from different backgrounds, yet they share the same drive: to live a better life.\n\nHowever, this access to a better life is often limited by their economic status. Mostly a low-income neighborhood the opportunities that my community has access to are not the same as their high-income counterparts. When you drive to more affluent neighborhoods such as Coral Gables or South Miami, it is almost impossible to miss the combination of palm trees, grass, and beach sunflowers decorating the sidewalks and main streets. Yet, the moment you cross eight street, the green life gets replaced by cracked buildings, trash, and rubble from construction.\n\nLittle Havana lacks green spaces. *The International Journal of Environmental Research* and Public Health defines green spaces as \"land use that has notable contributions to urban environments in terms of ecology, aesthetics, or public health but which serves human needs and uses\" (Shepley et al., 2019). The incorporation of green spaces into urban communities brings many benefits with it.\n\nThe first is a decrease in crime. A 2021 report by the FBI established that Little Havana had a crime rate 40% above the national crime level. The incorporation of green space can lead to a reduction in crime. A study examining the correlation between violent crime and urban green spaces in Philadelphia found that there was a significant reduction in crime in areas in which green spaces were implemented. Thus, the incorporation of green spaces allows for\nincreased community presence and less coverage for illicit activity to go unnoticed.\n\nNext, we have an increase in air quality. This is extremely important, especially as we enter the post-pandemic era. A study by Arnt Diener, a scientist who works for the World Health Organization, discovered that green spaces with vegetation lead to a decrease in air-borne diseases. Additionally, green spaces help to alleviate the effects of climate change; Miami is severely impacted by climate change and has experienced a recent increase in floods and rising temperatures. The incorporation of green space in Little Havana would improve not only the air quality but also decrease the damages brought by climate change as the green spaces with trees and other forms of vegetation (i.e plants, weeds, vegetables) can alter the way the environment works.\n\nLastly, green spaces have a great impact on mental health. A community report conducted by the University of Miami in 2020, found that over 16.1% of individuals in\nMiami-Dade reported “poor” mental health. A study published in the journal of Public Health concluded that exposure to green spaces was correlated to a decrease in anxiety and other mood disorders. Therefore, implementing a green space can lead to a reduction in mood disorders and help ease the minds of the community.\n\nWhat is the call to action? There exist a lot two blocks from my house, located at 3850 NW 4th Terrace, it sits empty, with only a billboard ad post at the top right corner. People in my neighborhood use this lot for many purposes. Dogs run there in the morning, people use the lot for refuge overnight, people exercise, and others litter there. This empty lot takes up an entire block, yet it is fenced and locked at times. State Representative Michael Grieco, as a\nrepresentative for Little Havana and other Miami-Dade County areas, it is imperative for the benefit of the community that you present the people of Little Havana with access to a green space in which we can be safe, healthy, and active. It is your duty to the people to un-privatize the lot and turn it into a green space that combines recreational activities, ecological, and aesthetic purposes. It is your duty to help Little Havana become greener.",
